  title: About our project
  description: Our six-wheeled rover have a custom rocker-bogie suspension system with a low center of gravity designed for better stability and manoeuvrability. We have develop a robotic manipulator with 5 degrees of freedom with a task-specific end effector for better operational accuracy and repeatability. Our rover is having a robust autonomous system capable of path planning and traversal, specially trained for highly uncertain and challenging terrains.

    description: Falcon Heavy’s first stage incorporates 27 Merlin engines across three aluminum-lithium alloy rocket cores containing liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellant. Falcon Heavy generates more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.
    attributes:
      number of engines: 27
      thrust at sea level: 22,819 kN / 5,130,000 lbf
      thrust in vacuum: 24,681 kN / 5,548,500 lbf

  - title: Landing Legs
    image: payload.png
    description: |
      The Falcon Heavy first stage is equipped with 12 landing legs (4 on each booster) made of state-of-the-art carbon fiber with aluminum honeycomb.
      All 12 landing legs are stowed along the side of each booster until just prior to landing.

  - title: Interstage
    image: rover.png
    description: |
      The interstage is a composite structure that connects the center core on the first stage and second stages and holds the release and separation system.
      ## GRID FINS
      Falcon Heavy is equipped with 12 hypersonic grid fins, four on each booster, positioned at the base of the interstage or nosecone which orients by moving the center of pressure during reentry.

  - title: Second Stage
    image: engine.png
    description: Falcon Heavy draws upon Falcon 9’s proven design, which minimizes stage separation events and maximizes reliability. The second-stage Merlin Vacuum Engine delivers the rocket’s payload to orbit after the main engines cut off and the first-stage cores separate.
    attributes:
      number of engines: 1
      burn time: 397 sec
      thrust: 981 kN / 220,500 lbf
