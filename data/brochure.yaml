    Our six-wheeled rover have a custom rocker-bogie suspension system with a low
    center of gravity designed for better stability and manoeuvrability. We have develop a robotic
    manipulator with 5 degrees of freedom with a task-specific end effector for better operational
    accuracy and repeatability. Our rover is having a robust autonomous system capable of path
    planning and traversal, specially trained for highly uncertain and challenging terrains.
